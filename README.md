Emotion Recogition using RNNs

This project is a 2nd year research project for academic purposes, realised by Loïc BOUCHERY & Florian POLSTER--PRIETO.

The goal was to test the performances of the Statistical Reccurent Unit (SRU) based on the following paper :
Junier B Oliva, Barnabás Póczos, and Jeff Schneider. The statistical recurrent unit. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 2671–2680, 2017.

The implementation of the SRU Cell used is the one made by ribeiromiranda on the following repository :

We tested the model along with other RNNs on the AFEW Dataset (https://cs.anu.edu.au/few/AFEW.html) with the gracious permission of the creators.
